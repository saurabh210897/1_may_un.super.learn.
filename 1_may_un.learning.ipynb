    "# Using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has several limitations. Here are some of the main limitations and potential ways \n",
    "# to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Imbalanced Data: Accuracy does not adequately capture the performance when the class distribution is imbalanced, meaning one class \n",
    "# has significantly more instances than others. In such cases, a classifier that predicts the majority class for all instances may achieve high accuracy, \n",
    "# but it fails to capture the performance on minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Addressing this limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use class-specific metrics: Instead of relying solely on accuracy, consider class-specific metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, \n",
    "# or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) for each class. These metrics provide insights into the performance of \n",
    "# the classifier on individual classes, accounting for the imbalanced distribution.\n",
    "# Misclassification Costs: Accuracy treats all types of misclassifications equally, even though different misclassifications may have different consequences or costs.\n",
    "# For example, misclassifying a positive instance as negative (false negative) may have more severe consequences than misclassifying a negative instance as positive \n",
    "# (false positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Addressing this limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use cost-sensitive metrics: Assign costs or weights to different types of misclassifications and use metrics such as cost-sensitive accuracy,\n",
    "# cost-sensitive precision, or cost-sensitive recall. These metrics consider the specific consequences or costs associated with different types\n",
    "# of misclassifications and provide a more nuanced evaluation.\n",
    "# Ambiguous Class Boundaries: In some cases, the class boundaries may be inherently ambiguous, making it difficult to assign clear-cut labels. \n",
    "# Accuracy alone may not capture the model's ability to make meaningful distinctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Addressing this limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use probabilistic predictions: Instead of binary predictions, consider the probabilistic outputs of the classifier.\n",
    "# Evaluate the performance using metrics such as log loss, Brier score, or information gain, which measure the quality of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "# These metrics account for the model's confidence in its predictions and provide a more nuanced evaluation.\n",
    "# Outliers and Robustness: Accuracy does not account for the model's robustness to outliers or its generalization performance.\n",
    "# A model that performs well on the training data may not necessarily generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Addressing this limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use cross-validation: Perform cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. This helps assess the model's\n",
    "# generalization ability and identify overfitting or underfitting issues.\n",
    "# Evaluate additional metrics: Consider other metrics such as precision-recall curves, ROC curves, or average precision score to evaluate the model's\n",
    "# performance across different thresholds and assess its robustness to outliers.\n",
    "# It is important to consider the specific characteristics of the classification task, the class distribution, and the potential costs associated \n",
    "# with misclassifications when selecting appropriate evaluation metrics. Using a combination of metrics that address the limitations mentioned above provides \n",
    "# a more comprehensive and meaningful evaluation of the classification model's performance."
